## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I revised some of the flexbox concepts (although the ideal way to finish this was by using css-grid). I added a bit of hover motion to the cards. I also added shadowy effect to the cards. It was quite a good challenge for a newbie like me.

### Continued development

Further planning to learn css-grid.
